- Background color: Light blue (#E5F5F9), a desaturated shade of the primary, creates a clean and professional backdrop.
- Accent color: Violet (#8E24AA), analogous to blue but provides a bold contrast for calls to action and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern look, as itâ€™s suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Custom-designed icons to visually represent features and benefits. These should have a modern, tech-inspired aesthetic.
- Modular, grid-based layout with ample white space to maintain a clean and professional aesthetic. Cards and layered elements should enhance the UI.
- Fluid animations and transitions, including fade-ins, slide-ups, and hover effects, should be used thoughtfully to enhance user experience.
